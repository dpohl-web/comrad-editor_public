## ‚ú® Architectural Highlights & Key Features

This application is engineered with a robust and scalable architecture, leveraging the power of the Angular ecosystem to deliver a feature-rich editing experience.

-   **Modern Angular Framework (v18):**
    Built on the latest version of Angular, the editor benefits from a strong, component-based architecture, lazy loading, and a powerful dependency injection system. This results in a highly modular, maintainable, and performant application, even as complexity grows.

-   **Professional UI with Angular Material:**
    The entire user interface is constructed using **Angular Material**, providing a consistent, accessible, and visually appealing experience that feels native to the WordPress environment. It includes a comprehensive suite of UI components like drag-and-drop lists, steppers, and advanced form controls.

-   **Rich Text Editing with TinyMCE:**
    For creating detailed question text and descriptions, the editor integrates **TinyMCE**, a market-leading WYSIWYG editor. This gives content creators the power and flexibility of a full-featured text editor directly within the questionnaire builder.

-   **Dynamic and Reactive Form Building:**
    Leveraging Angular's powerful **Reactive Forms**, the editor allows for the dynamic construction of complex, multi-page questionnaires. State management and validation are handled efficiently, providing a smooth and error-free user experience.

-   **Internationalization (i18n) Ready:**
    With **ngx-translate**, the editor is built from the ground up to support multiple languages, allowing it to be used in a global context.

-   **Seamless WordPress Integration:**
    The application is specifically designed to be built and embedded into a WordPress plugin, with scripts to automate the process of creating a production build and copying the files to the correct plugin directory.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To set up the project locally for development, you will need Node.js (version >=20.16.0).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/dpohl-web/comrad-editor_public.git
    cd comrad-editor_public
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    This command starts the Angular development server and uses a proxy configuration (`proxy.conf.json`) to forward API requests to a local WordPress instance, enabling seamless development.
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Scripts

The `package.json` includes several scripts to streamline the development and build process:

| Command                   | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm start`               | Starts the local development server with proxying.                          |
